R notebook from Kaggle Titanic competition [R tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/exploring-survival-on-the-titanic).

```{r}
library('ggplot2')
library('ggthemes')
library('scales')
library('dplyr')
library('mice')
library('randomForest')
```

### Load and check data

```{r}
train <- read.csv('./data/train.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
test  <- read.csv('./data/test.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)

full  <- bind_rows(train, test) # bind training & test data

# check data
str(full)
```

### Feature engineering

#### Names

This [regex testing and debugging site](https://regex101.com) was useful for understanding what gsub was doing.

```{r}
# Grab title from passenger names
full$Title <- gsub('(.*, )|(\\..*)', '', full$Name)

# Show title counts by sex
table(full$Sex, full$Title)
```

```{r}
# Titles with very low cell counts to be combined to "rare" level
rare_title <- c('Dona', 'Lady', 'the Countess','Capt', 'Col', 'Don', 
                'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer')

# Also reassign mlle, ms, and mme accordingly
full$newTitle = full$Title
full$newTitle[full$newTitle == 'Mlle']        <- 'Miss' 
full$newTitle[full$newTitle == 'Ms']          <- 'Miss'
full$newTitle[full$newTitle == 'Mme']         <- 'Mrs' 
full$newTitle[full$newTitle %in% rare_title]  <- 'Rare Title'

# Show title counts by sex again
table(full$Sex, full$newTitle)
```

```{r}
# Finally, grab surname from passenger name
full$Surname <- sapply(full$Name,  
                      function(x) strsplit(x, split = '[,.]')[[1]][1])

cat(paste('We have <b>', nlevels(factor(full$Surname)), '</b> unique surnames. I would be interested to infer ethnicity based on surname --- another time.'))
```

#### Families

```{r}
# Create a family size variable including the passenger themselves
full$Fsize <- full$SibSp + full$Parch + 1

# Create a family variable 
full$Family <- paste(full$Surname, full$Fsize, sep='_')
```


##### Visualizations

```{r}
# Use ggplot2 to visualize the relationship between family size & survival
# aes: aesthetic mappings
ggplot(full[1:891,], aes(x = Fsize, fill = factor(Survived))) +
  geom_bar(stat='count', position='dodge') +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(1:11)) +
  labs(x = 'Family Size') +
  theme_few()
```

```{r}
# Discretize family size
full$FsizeD[full$Fsize == 1] <- 'singleton'
full$FsizeD[full$Fsize < 5 & full$Fsize > 1] <- 'small'
full$FsizeD[full$Fsize > 4] <- 'large'

# Show family size by survival using a mosaic plot
mosaicplot(table(full$FsizeD, full$Survived), main='Family Size by Survival', shade=TRUE)
```

### Data cleanup

```{r}
full$Embarked[full$Embarked == ""] <- "Embarked"
```
